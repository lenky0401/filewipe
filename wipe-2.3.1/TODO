Things to do:

        --	freebsd: fix block devs and file types

	--	fix single quote in man page

	--	follow symlinks when they point to a device

	--	handle changes in window width (need sighandler for that)

        --	show the path instead of just the filename & truncate beginning if too long

	--	display throughput

	--	realpath() might be useful

	--	add more support for systems w/o a random dev
		use stdin as an alternate entropy source

	--	random length truncations
		to try and screw with indirect block pointersn and extents

	--	inode/directory scrambling
		randomly create new files in directory containing target(s)
		create random (dir local) hard links.

		basically, try to wipe everything in struct stat

	--	switch to a total percentage for all the files selected,
		kind of like how apt-get does it.

		something like these:

		[blah.txt: 60%] 24%

		blah.txt: 60% [24%]

		[24%] blah.txt: 60%

		probably go with the last example (or maybe the first, or
		maybe even make it optional).
